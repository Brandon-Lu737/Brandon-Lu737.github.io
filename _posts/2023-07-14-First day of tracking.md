First day of tracking,

7:30-8:30 Meeting with Sid Amazon Future Engineering Scholarship

8:30-10:00 Internet surfing *waste of time intervention needed*

10:21 I can see that my mind will get very distracted in a `LogSeq` context. In fact, I don't think it's right for long-term deep thinking tasks at all. The browser is inherently distracting, same with `LogSeq`'s hyperlinks. In the future, I can see myself writingn journals in a plain documents in `Typora` while drawing data and inspriation from `LogSeq`.

What's the role of hand-writing paper-based documentation? **First,** I guess we can establish that we can't know the answer to that question right now. **Second**, for now, we can 

- Use `LogSeq` and `Safari Reading List` as a "Clipper", to collect large amount of data;
- Use `Paper` or `Goodnotes` to summarize them;
- Use `Typora` to further summarize and produce highly concentrated abstracts

There is definitely a mindset shift from paper journaling to digital journaling where the first one is far more personal. There are definitely some undeniable advantages for the latter, but it can't replace the first one.

I still don't think I should journal on `Goodnotes`, and will reserve that for paper for now.

It's sometimes a bad idea to have an `all-in-one` system like `LogSeq`. I guess sometimes the principle of `Linux` still applies: create apps that do small things and do them well.
