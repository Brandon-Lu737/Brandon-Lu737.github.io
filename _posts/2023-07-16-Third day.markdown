15:00- Start working on Multivariable calculus MIT course

Morning: woke up at 10 am and had breakfast. Then exhausted the 30-min quota of Netflix. After that, I clear the Safari Reading List which is productive. In the end, I watched some random YouTube videos  through the Google search feature to bypass the Screen Time restrictions.
