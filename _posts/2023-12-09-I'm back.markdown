14:51 Now I'm finally back! This is a long overdue update to my life.

This is a first post for me to make some changes to my life:

- Blog every day
- Try to incorporate some scheduled fun: gymming, mindfulness, taking the initiative to deepen friendships, etc
- Do [LogSeq](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwj2mMHquYODAxWlNjQIHVbxDqQQFnoECAwQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Flogseq.com%2F&usg=AOvVaw1PaeyFwf6Q3t5aBeqPQhg4&opi=89978449) for [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net)
- Get started on my personal CS project *something related to LogSeq and Anki*

What I'm proud of myself so far:

- [Toggl Track](https://toggl.com) every day
- Did fairly well in poli sci, a new field for me. And I was brave enough to explore different disciplines
- Deepen existing friendships and take the initiative to make new connections
- Exploring my multi-faceted personal identity
- Really practiced very good self-care

I'll keep you guys posted.
