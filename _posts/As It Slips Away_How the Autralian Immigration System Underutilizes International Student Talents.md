# As It Slips Away: How the Autralian Immigration System Underutilizes International Student Talents

48% of students at Go8 universities are international in 2022. As Australia increasingly faces labor shortages in industries such as [aged care, healthcare, information technology](https://thenewdaily.com.au/finance/work/2023/03/13/skills-shortage-in-demand-jobs/#:~:text=New%20quarterly%20data%20in%20the,round%20out%20the%20top%20five.), those students can be an untapped human potential. However, only [16%](https://www.sbs.com.au/language/punjabi/en/article/should-international-students-in-australia-be-offered-clearer-permanent-residency-pathways/flzufdi8p#) of incoming international students stay and become permanent residents compared to 27% in Canada. It doesn't seem that international graduates are so eager to leave, as they can't even be eligible to work for many Australian companies. This huge difference does not only mean the loss for Australian employers, but also high level of stress and uncertainty for international students. What is happening?

The COVID-19 pandemic saw the biggest scandal in Australian edcuation history: students are entitiled to working for an unlimited number of hours, while previously they can only work for 48 hours per fortnight. This measure is myopic, for it filled the labor gaps yet tarnished the reputation of the calilber of international graduates in the long run. Ingenuine students who went to Australia not to earn a college degree but to enroll in shady academic programs can now put studying aside and work long-hour shifts during studies.

This is a regrettable situation but the international student market in Australia isn't any better in some other time. They are treated as cash cows which are admitted in low quality, large quantity and are expected to leave Australia straight after they graduate. What's a better ATM machine than that? However, if Australia only treat foreign students as one-off ATM machines, it will be far too short-sighted.

Think about this: Australia has an aging workforce, like most developed countries, and is not much better than countries like Japan and Canada. Its tight labor (though perhaps not so when a recession hits) constantly needs fresh blood to sustain itself. How to determine the quality of incoming migrants? Language skills, age, and skills. Yet if you look at applicants aged over 30 years old, the prospects are not as promising. First, let's not pretend that a significant portion of immigrats are native English speakers. The sooner the students get exposed to a full English environment, the more likely they can develop a near-native fluency. For Australia to continue to have the welfare that many people all take too for granted, the skill level of residents is crucial to generate the most GDP per capita. But many high-earning jobs require very good English. The Australian Labor Market Report shows that some of the top jobs in need are aged care workers, teachers, health professionals and STEM workers. They all require significant interpersonal interactions conducted in English. And these language skills cannot be cultivated through a fast track of one or two years. As adults age and neuroplasticity wanes, improving languae skills can only be even harder.

The second reason is the immense tax-paying potential of young international graduates before they retire. Retirement is a ticking clock after which most people go into dormant mode and start enjoying Australian welfare to its fullest. An economic model is certainly not sustainable if the people seeking it far exceeds the people providing it in number. For some other typical migrants, however, they may well be in their mid-30s. Compared to a typical undergrate or graduate students, they will contribute nearly 10 fewer years of taxes to Australian economy.

So why do international grads still face significant hurdles in securing a job relevant to their field and stay in Australia? The data is clear: only 30% of international students work in a relevant field after graduation. The news that a engineer-trained grad has to resort to driving Uber and low-skilled positions isn't news but the norm.

It comes down to a self-perpetuating vicious cycle: Australian tertiary education admit international students at a lower bar compared to universities in Canada and the US. While students with high skills still attend, with a number of them Dalyell Scholars in the case of USYD, companies lack the recognition for international talents and think that they cannot stay in Australia after they graduate anyway, why bother giving them an internship or a graduate program? As such, companies continue to fail to effectively identify rising international stars assuming that the government will kick them out regardless, while the government continues to exploit ATM machines without feeling the need to improving the status quo.

The current migration pathways for international grads are severely limited. How to change it? It first requires an effective system to identify international talents while they are studying at university. It should be even easier than assessing applicants with foreign work experience! You don't need to worry about rigged CVs, made-up work experience and lengthy labor market assessments. All you need to do is to look at the students' transcripts compared to average students at the specific university and some local work experience. In fact, assessing emering internatonal talents is far easier than assessing adult ones as you have very objective methods to evaluate the potential contribution to the Australian economy, just like the ATAR system. We can already see some companies making these evaluations through easy, standardized ways. Top financial firms in Australia such as Deloitte, use IELTS score in lieu of permanent residency or citizenship requirements. If in doubt about the job applicants' language skills, an request for English test scores is far more humane than a rejection letter based on PR status.

Second, it calls for a more stable migration pathways for international superstars. One core concern for employers hesitating to hire international students for internship or graduate programs is that they might not stay in Australia after they graduate. The firms will be effectively grooming talents for international competitors. An easy way to address such conern is to offer more dependable visa programs, and countries like Canada are already doing this. Taking British Columbia for example, graduates will be eligible for Provincial Nomination if they secure a job offer in Canada, effectively giving their point-system application a 600-point boost, eliminating any concerns for permanent residency unless they commit some serious crimes. That effectively puts an   equal sign between a job offer and stable immigration status. It means that companies can hire whoever they prefer with a sound mind that the new hires will be able to work for them for a long time. Australia also has similar programs, but those are long and arduous, which can take months to complete before the student even goes to work. Such delays and volatility certainly deter employers from tapping into the hugh pool of candidates.

Third, it requires us to reimagine the international education industry. It shouldn't only cater to some specializations that Australia dooesn't need, e.g., finance, accounting. Universities should prioritize what talents the country lacks, and recruit international students accordingly. It should level the bar of admission for international students with its international students. It shouldn't admit students with bad grades but good money while being the top 20 universities in the world (in the case of UniMelb, USYD, and UNSW). It should cast international grads in a new light that they are highly capable of filling the dire needs of some Australian industries, but not some cash cows who are harvested and deported.

Since the 1960s when the white Australia policy ends, this nation has come a long way in appreciate foreign talents in an aging society. From "populate or perish" to "upskill or sink", talents are foundamental for a more powerful Australia, and where the gaps are not filled by domestic students, it shouldn't hesitate to hire international ones. The Albanese government has already implemented some strategies to streamline the visa evaluation process and identify international expertise. The government will release its strategies later this year when  applicants are applying for admission to the spring term next year. Can it lure back some minds who are already drifting towards countries that appreciate them? Or is it already too late.
