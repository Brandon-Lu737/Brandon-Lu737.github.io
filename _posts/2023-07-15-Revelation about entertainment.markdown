My intention with my digital tools:

- Mass capture with uPic to store information from the NET: `Logseq`
- Preliminary capture: all study notes must go through: `Goodnotes iPad -> Logseq flashcards`
- Preliminary capture: all newspaper notes must go through: `Goodnotes iPad -> Logseq flashcards`
- Newspaper notes: `Logseq` and try to recount after reading every article
- Studying (flashcards) from MOOC and uni: `Logseq`
- Book notes: `Goodnotes iPad -> Logseq flashcards`
- Diary and interstitial journaling: `Typora mac`
- Creativity: `Physical paper`
- Meeting: `Small notebook`

We should produce a **weekly summary** containing the most crucial information about the week, **so that we don't get lost in the wealth of journaling records**.
